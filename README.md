# Elijah Skeirik

## echo $(whoami)
My name is Elijah Skeirik. I am a 21-year-old front-end, back-end, SEO-guy, marketer, sales rep, and general hat-wearer
at Mr. Electric of Tri-Cities. I programmed my whole life as a hobby, mostly doing systems-level programming (Rust, C++)
but I had wanted to study philosophy and linguistics. After spending some time crushing college courses in Greek and Theology, I got married, and tragically had my full scholarship revoked on a technicality (long story short, married students couldn't qualify). I immediately turned around and began working at an electrical company first as a sales rep,
then as an electrician's apprentice, and now as an actual full-stack engineer (team of one). I still spend a lot of time studying foreign language, and I have experience in Spanish, Italian, Latin, Greek, and Russian. I also write a lot of poems and read a lot of books.  
   
**LAST BOOK READ:** *The Consolation of Philosophy - Boethius*

I made the brand, the front-end, and back-end of this cool website: https://dryforce.llc  
It also has an admin panel that you can't see, but I'll include a video for you.
